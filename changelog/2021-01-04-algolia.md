We just added [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) integration to our documentation site (yes, **this site!**). Give it a try and let us know what you think ðŸ˜ƒ It is on the top right corner of your screen, or just press `CMD` + `K`.

**Flyyer is a developer-first company** and we are really committed to Developer Experience. The integration was very straightforward thanks to the Docusaurus presets we are using.

We have amazing things on our pipeline, stay tuned!
