Previously emojis were not rendered, until now ðŸš€

We just released [@flyyer/cli@1.11.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flyyer/cli) which adds an additional post-procesisng step to add Emojis via [twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/), an amazing open-source library from Twitter.

Here is an example:

```txt

  ?title=Now+with+Emojis+ðŸ˜ƒ
```
