We just released [@flyyer/cli@1.10.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flyyer/cli) which included additional CLI flags to allow developers specify their own directories and different deploy configurations.

Here is an example:

```sh title="Terminal.app"
flyyer build src --config flyyer.config.staging.js
flyyer deploy --dry
```
