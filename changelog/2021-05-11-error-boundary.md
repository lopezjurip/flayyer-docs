We are adding an error handler when an unhandled error ocurres during rendering.

You can start using it by upgrading `@flayyer/cli` to `^1.18.0`:

```sh
yarn add --dev @flayyer/cli
```

This feature is not implemented yet on Vue but you can keep track of the process on https://github.com/flayyer/flayyer-cli/issues/13
