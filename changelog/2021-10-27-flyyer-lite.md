Hello fellow developers ðŸ‘‹

This feature has been around for a while but it requires a special mention here.

JavaScript projects are very sensible to third-party dependencies file sizes because each byte sent to the browsers can reduce the time to interaction.

Our JavaScript library `@flyyer/flyyer` includes some cryptographic functions to [sign URLs](/guides/javascript/flyyer-js#signed-urls), but if you are not using this feature you can use our lightweight module that doesn't include those functions.

```sh
npm install --save @flyyer/flyyer-lite

yarn add @flyyer/flyyer-lite
```

The code change is minimal:

```diff
- import { Flyyer } from "@flyyer/flyyer";
+ import { Flyyer } from "@flyyer/flyyer-lite";
```

See the difference here:
