Let's speak the same language.

## Glossary

Here is the list of the technical terms.

### Flyyer

The name of the service but also **we call "flyyer" any smart image generated by our service**. We are composed by three main services:

* [Dashboard](https://www.flyyer.io/dashboard) (`www.flyyer.io/dashboard`) â€” Dashboard, billing, account management, project setup, og:image preview and management; and social image generation UI.
* [Flyyer CDN](https://www.flyyer.io) (`cdn.flyyer.io/v2/`) â€” Our main service, your og:images should point to Flyyer CDN so we can scan your website and render images when your are being shared on social media.
* [Flyyer Render](https://www.flyyer.io/render) (`cdn.flyyer.io/render/v2/`) â€” Template rendering server. Content provided explicitly through variables for full customization. It is more imperative because you need to explicitly setup the calling parameters and variables to create images. Flyyer CDN uses this service but takes contextual values from your website and applies the rules defined on Flyyer.io.

### Slug

The machine-friendly version of a text. Example: `Hello there!` as slug would be `hello-there`.

### Identifier

Synonym of [Slug](#slug).

### Template

This is the most important thing about Flyyer. **This is in reality a webpage (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) acting as a template to create dynamic images** . What is great about this templates is that you can use them to generate infinite amount of images based on variables.

For developers and engineers: a template is a **web component** (React, Vue, etc). To develop templates you can start a project following this [section](./getting-started.md). **Every template has a name corresponding to the name of its file** (similar to Next.js and _pages_).

Take a look at this example, here we have a template with multiple [variables](#variables) and some of all the possible outcomes:

![image](/img/images/demo.png)

### Variables

These templates receives **variables** as input and renders images based on those inputs. This is way more smarter than other image services whom only allows to compose images, add watermarks, etc. You can do all of that and even more with custom login and your own styles.

Variables are passed through the unique URL of a flyyer as **queryparams**. Eg: This is an actual URL of a Flyyer with a param `title`:

```bash
https://cdn.flyyer.io/render/v2/flyyer/charming-man/main.png?title=Title
```

![Example demo image created with Flyyer](https://cdn.flyyer.io/render/v2/flyyer/charming-man/main.png?title=Title)

Inside the component it looks like this:

```jsx title="templates/main.js" {4}
import React from "react";

export default function DemoTemplate({ variables }) {
  const title = variables.title; // ðŸ‘ˆ variable from queryparams
  return <h1>{title}</h1>;
}
```

:::tip
To read more about variables and how to support objects and array go to [Complex variables](./advanced/complex-variables.md).

### Schema

The next level of [variables](#variables). The problem with plain variables is that they are hard to discover and you can receive unwanted inputs.

**Example:** a variable `price` would expect an `number` but when serialized as queryparam it becomes `price=20` which is indistinguishable from `"20"` as a `string`.

We created [@flyyer/variables](https://github.com/useflyyer/flyyer-variables) so you can known what you can send to a template and being able to parse inputs to their correct types.

You only need to export an `schema` object from your template files.

```tsx
import { Variable as V, Static, Validator } from "@flyyer/variables";

export const schema = V.Object({
  title: V.String({ description: "Displayed on https://flyyer.io" }),
  description: V.Optional(V.String({ default: "Hello world" })),
  image: V.Optional(V.Image({
    description: "Image URL",
    examples: ["https://flyyer.io/logo.png"],
  })),
});
const validator = new Validator(schema);

type Variables = Static<typeof schema>; // Typescript users

export default function Template({ variables }: TemplateProps<Variables>) {
  const {
    data: { title, description, image } // safe values! ðŸ˜ƒ
  } = validator.parse(variables);
  // ...
}
```

It will look like this on your Flyyer Dashboard:

### Deck

A deck  is a collection of [Templates](#template). The idea of a deck is being able to share common styles, components and code between many templates. Each deck is identified by a _slug_ defined in `flyyer.config.js`.

### Tenant

Every user belongs to an organization. We call this entities "tenants" or "companies" for simplicity. Each tenant is identified by an unique _slug_, eg: `my-company`. Each tenant has many [Decks](#deck).

Tenants can also be single users.

Each tenant has a public profile with their public templates at [Flyyer Community](https://www.flyyer.io/community).

### Company

Synonym of [Tenant](#tenant).

## URL anatomy

### Flyyer CDN

### Flyyer Render

Every FlyyerRender URL is built around this schema. For variables refer to [Variables](#variables) and [Complex variables](./advanced/complex-variables.md).

* `:tenant` â€” is the Tenant's slug
* `:deck` â€” is the Deck's slug
* `:template` â€” is the Template's slug
* `:extension` â€” the extension of the rendered image
  * Possible values: `png`, `webp`, `jpeg` (`jpg` is an alias)
  * Defaults to `jpeg`.
* `:version` â€” The version control number of your deck.
  * Defaults to `_` which means _latest version_.
  * Omit to always use the latest version (recommended).

**Variables are passed down as queryparams.**

:::note
Please note that `:tenant`, `:deck` and `:template` are always **required**, everything else is optional.
:::

### Short format

Shortest form: always latest version and defaults to `.jpeg` format.

```bash
https://cdn.flyyer.io/r/v2/:tenant/:deck/:template?variable=value

# Example:
https://cdn.flyyer.io/r/v2/flyyer/landing/demo?title=Title
```

### Long format

Longest form: explicit version and extension. The namespace `/r/` is an alias of `/render/`.

```bash
https://cdn.flyyer.io/render/v2/:tenant/:deck/:template.:version.:extension?variable=value

# Example:
https://cdn.flyyer.io/render/v2/flyyer/landing/demo.1608497482.png?title=Title&description=Description+text
```
