## Installation

Let our Wordpress plugin integrate Flyyer for you. It requires **Yoast SEO** plugin and PHP >= 14.0.

### 1. Download the plugin zip

Download the zip here: [flyyer-wordpress-plugin.zip](https://github.com/useflyyer/flyyer-wp/releases/latest/download/flyyer-wordpress-plugin.zip). Feel free to review the source code here: [github.com/useflyyer/flyyer-wp](https://github.com/useflyyer/flyyer-wp).

### 2. Add `Yoast SEO` plugin

Download **Yoast SEO** from the plugins list (Plugins > Add New > Search for `Yoast SEO`) or [from here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/).

### 3. Upload the plugin

From your admin dashboard go to the **Plugins** menu. Click on **Upload Plugin** and upload the zipped file `flyyer-wordpress-plugin.zip`. If you downloaded `Yoast SEO` zip, then upload it the same way.

### 4. Set your `project-slug`

You can Find your `project-slug` in [your dashboard](https://flyyer.io/dashboard/_/projects/_/integrate?ref=docs). If you don't have a project yet, [create one here](https://flyyer.io/get-started?ref=docs).

Write write it down in the Flyyer settings. By default it's your domain name but it may be different. Looks like this:

If you inspect the `<head />` of your HTML you should see the `og:image` and `twitter:image` tags with `cdn.flyyer.io` URLs with your `project-slug` and current `pathname` on it. If you're having trouble, **please make sure both plugins are active** in the Plugins menu.
