## Installation

This module is agnostic to any PHP framework and requires PHP >= 7.1.

### 1. Install `flyyer/flyyer`

Install it with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```bash title="Terminal.app"
composer require flyyer/flyyer
```

### 2. Generate smart image URLs

Find your `project-slug` in [your dashboard](https://flyyer.io/dashboard/_/projects/_/integrate?ref=docs). If you don't have a project yet, [create one here](https://flyyer.io/get-started?ref=docs).

Now you can generate smart image URLs like shown below.

```php
require_once 'vendor/flyyer/flyyer/src/Flyyer.php';

$flyyer = new Flyyer
  # Your project slug
  'your-project-slug',
  # The current pathname of your website, try to set it dynamically
  '/path/to/product',
);

// Use this image URL in your <head/> tags
$url = $flyyer->href();
// > https://cdn.flyyer.io/v2/your-project-slug/_/__v=1618281823/path/to/product
```

Take a look into the [Wordpress integration guide](/guides/php/wordpress) to see a full example for your specific setup. You're invited to [contribute to the PHP documentation](https://github.com/useflyyer/flyyer-docs/tree/main/guides/php) and add your own guide for other technologies.

:::note
The meta-tags code needs to be static, processed at build time or server-side rendered for link previews to work.

$flyyer = new Flyyer('your-project-slug', '/path/to/product');
$flyyer->secret="your-secret-key";
