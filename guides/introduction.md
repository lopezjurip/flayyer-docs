## SEO is good

Nowadays people talk about SEO and how important it is. They are right! Your site needs to be easy to find on Google and having a better positioning than your competition is crucial to overcome the already saturated global market.

A key factor –but not the only one– to improve SEO is having correctly setup the **meta-tags** of your website. These tags are just a code snippet your site must have in the `<head>` of its HTML code.

Once you have these meta-tags it is going to be easier for indexation services like Google or social networks such as Facebook, Twitter or Linkedin to find your site and complement the link when shared with some additional rich information.

## SEO and beyond

**There is an overload of information on the internet, and the war for user's attention is becoming more and more competitive.**

Your site can have 100/100 score on [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) or similar, **but that's not going to be enough to capture user's attention.**

Remember when YouTube videos used to have very simple thumbnail previews? Those days are over, today every video on YouTube has very well-crafted cover images with text and images, every single video wants to be unique. This is the next step we are working for, but for the whole internet.

## What is Flayyer?
